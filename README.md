# Tic-Tac-Toe
Play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

What I Learned:
 
I learned more how to work with dictionaries since I used that to create the playing space.

I also became more comfortable with using 'while loops'. At first I was reluctant to use 'while loops' because I felt more comfortable using 'if statements' but 'if statements' are not always the ideal choice. I used while choices where ever the user may enter an unwanted input.
